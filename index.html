        <p>What does it mean to have a mental health disorder? Depression and anxiety, and the lesser-known panic disorder, often overlap in symptoms and diagnoses. With rates of mental health issues among college students increasing, some claim <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201402/the-college-student-mental-health-crisis">college student mental health is in a crisis</a>. Here are the stories of students and recent alumni of Texas State University who suffer from mental health disorders, how they came to terms with their illnesses and how they&apos;ve affected their lives.</p>

      <p id="intro-first"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tories like the one above play out daily for students with mental health disorders. One of the most challenging aspects of coming to terms with these disorders is recongizing when one actually has one. Discussion often revolves around whether the issues are <i>real</i> or not, and whether medication is necessary. Some consider mental health disorders not to be real, which often further keeps those who suffer from seeking help.</p>
        
        <p>Every person who struggles with mentl health disorders has a different story. Their issues manifest in different ways, their symptoms often overlap with other disorders, making it hard to self-diagnose. And while each disorder is separate, they often are diagnosed together, or tendencies for the effects of one disorder may manifest like another.</p>
      
      <p>Below are three stories of students at Texas State Unviersity who have dealt with mental health disorders. From coming to terms with their respecitve issues, seeking treatment and seeing how the disorder has affected their lives and the lives of those around them, these stories show the profound effects these issues have on the lives of students before, during and after their time in university. Perhaps these features will open the eyes of skeptics to one of today&apos;s largest health issues, showing that the problems are more than just bad states of mind.</p>

        <p class="text">Ashley Yosko sits alone in her dorm on the campus of Texas State University. Or, as alone as she can be in her shared room with a random roommate. It&apos;s the spring semester, and just less than a year after leaving high school, she notices her life isn&apos;t quite the same.</p>

        <p class="text">Something&apos;s been nagging her for the past few months, and it seems it&apos;s getting worse.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;It wasn&apos;t like something switched one day, or anything,&quot; Yosko said, sipping on a mocha from a local coffee shop in San Marcos, where she&apos;s lived for the past three years. &quot;It was kind of like a gradual progression where I just got to…I didn&apos;t really like going out much, I kind of avoided people, to where it got kind of crazy and I didn&apos;t even want to walk down the hallway, I just felt down all the time.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">She eventually recognized the problems stemmed from her mental health. But like many who first realize something&apos;s wrong, she turned to overthinking and self-diagnosis in attempts to find the problem.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;I was trying to figure out, myself, what is it that I have, and I was trying to self-diagnose, and that wasn&apos;t good,&quot; Yosko said. &quot;I was like, I&apos;m probably just depressed and it&apos;s fine. And then I was like, maybe I&apos;m bipolar. I didn&apos;t know. I realized I was alone, by myself all the time, and I thought about it a lot. Why can&apos;t I have any friends, why am I doing everything by myself, and it started getting to where I was avoiding people, avoiding places, worrying about everything, even tiny things. Little things would make me tick off. Everything had to be a certain way, and I would get really tense if it wasn&apos;t that way.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">The isolation didn&apos;t help. With few close friends in town, Yosko didn&apos;t have anyone to ask for advice, what steps should be taken to help her feel better, or if something worse than mental health disorders were the cause.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;I didn&apos;t open up to anybody in college about it,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t know anybody that well. I started going to this thing called Young Life, it&apos;s a Christian organization, and I had never heard of it before college. I started going to that and started talking to some people there, but I never opened up about the fact that I was alone all the time and kind of freaking out and wasn&apos;t feeling like myself. I never told any of those people about that, I didn&apos;t tell my roommate, I didn&apos;t tell anybody.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">She finally found the courage to confide in her mom, one of her closest family members. And even though she could finally talk about the problem, it was starting to get even worse.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;The only person I would start talking to about it was my mom,&quot; she said. &quot;I would just call her and be like, &apos;Hey, something&apos;s off.&apos; And my mom would really worry about me a lot. I didn&apos;t tell my dad, I didn&apos;t tell my sister, but I told my mom a lot, to the point where she thought I was going to hurt myself. I probably sometimes talked like that, too. I was probably like, &apos;I hate my life and I want to kill myself,&apos; because it was just awful. I just went to class and that was it. I buried myself in schoolwork so my parents didn&apos;t think anything was wrong with me.&quot;</p>
  
        <p class="text">She finally reached a critical point at the end of that semester, and her mom set up an appointment with their local physician, hoping Yosko could salvage the rest of her college career from the emotional strain of the first semesters.</p>

        <p class="text">The insecurity that stemmed from whatever the problem was almost convinced her not to go to the doctor.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;It got to the point where my mom knew so much, how I was struggling, that she made me go to the doctor in the summer,&quot; Yosko said.  &quot;She called and made the appointment for me, and I even told her before, I was like, &apos;Yes, I&apos;m really excited to go to this,&apos; and then the next day I&apos;d be like, &apos;No, I&apos;m not going to go.&apos; It would change every single day until I went.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">The day finally came, and Yosko bit the bullet. She went into the appointment still unsure about what was wrong but was ready to get some answers.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;At first, I didn&apos;t know, maybe I had depression or anxiety,&quot; she said. &quot;It kind of switches, and [the doctor] basically told me I have anxiety, but some of those elements [of depression] are still there. So, sometimes it feels really different.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">The doctor prescribed her a low dose of Prozac to calm her down and stabilize her mental state. Her anxiety, now officially diagnosed, still manifested itself in depressive symptoms, and the medication was to help over the course of her condition, not in the moment.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;It&apos;s more of a long-term medication rather than something you take when you&apos;re anxious in the moment because I&apos;m just anxious all the time,&quot; she said.</p>

        <p class="text">While her main issue was general anxiety occurring over long periods of time at random, there have been a few episodes where her issues spiked in the moment.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;I had a couple weird panic attacks, too,&quot; Yosko admitted. &quot;I wasn&apos;t diagnosed with that, but I had this really weird one during sophomore year of college where I woke up one day, and I was feeling just a little weird. So, I decided to go to the restroom, [thinking] it&apos;d be fine. I had the dorm where you had to go out [in the hall], and the restroom is right by it. In the bathroom I was sweating and freaking out and panicking, and then I left the restroom and passed out on the floor, right there. But nobody was in the hallway, nobody saw me, so I didn&apos;t tell anybody about it - except for my mom. It was for a good two minutes I was passed out. Everything was crazy, and I just get really hot and sweaty.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">After starting the medication, however, Yosko noticed her mood improving, though it took some time for the changes to set in. She made sure to start he treatment at home with her family to keep any adverse effects from having dire consequences.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;During the summer I started taking the medication while I was at home, so I was in a safe space to start taking it,&quot; Yosko said. &quot;I had never taken an antidepressant before, and I hear horror stories of people getting suicidal on them. I didn&apos;t want that to happen, so my family watched me. My mom and my sister knew about it, but I still don&apos;t even think my dad knows about it. I&apos;m not sure if he thinks mental illnesses are real. I just don&apos;t really talk to my dad about it.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">While her journey to treatment has lasted a few years, she still hasn&apos;t told many people, and two years after starting medication, her dad still doesn&apos;t really know her struggle.</p>

        <p class="text">Finding the courage to tell people beyond her doctor and mom is another struggle, one often resonated with other mental health disorder sufferers.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;The first non-family-member I told it to was one of my best friends from high school, and it was just kind of a weird conversation I had with her in a car after some event we went to,&quot; Yosko said. &quot;And I think he accepted it, but I don&apos;t think he knew how to take it.&quot;</p>

          <p class="text">Yosko finds it hard to talk about her mental health because those who&apos;ve never experienced issues of their own often can&apos;t relate. Many try to offer advice, though it&apos;s usually moot.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;Some people don&apos;t have it, and you talk to them about it, and they don&apos;t fully understand it,&quot; she said. &quot;They&apos;re like, &apos;Just chill out, have a drink, and it&apos;ll all be fine.&apos; And I&apos;m just like, &apos;I can&apos;t, that&apos;s not how it works.&apos;&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">One of the roadblocks in Yosko initially realizing something was wrong is how little awareness she had of mental health issues before her disorders became obstructive. While she thinks younger generations are getting better at accepting and talking about mental health, she still senses a lack of discussion around the topic that affects its acceptance in society.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;I didn&apos;t even really hear about it, probably, till I was in college,&quot; she said. &quot;You just don&apos;t hear people talk about it. You don&apos;t really think it&apos;s going to be you. You hear about mental health and you&apos;re like, &apos;Oh, not me,&apos; so you don&apos;t really read those things.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">This lack of discussion has affected how people perceive mental illnesses. Some still think they&apos;re not real, or someone is just nervous or sad. Yosko thinks progress is happening, but there&apos;s much work to be done given the commonality of mental health issues.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;I don&apos;t think my dad would take it seriously if I told him,&quot; she said with a grimace. &quot;I think more people from our generation definitely talk about than previous generations. It&apos;s pretty common, I&apos;ve read that…one in five Americans have anxiety, but it&apos;s still hard to talk about. I think people try to understand it, but it&apos;s a hard concept to get. It&apos;s socially acceptable now to be sad whenever somebody dies or whatever, but it&apos;s just weird to be <i>sad</i>.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">In all, Yosko still struggles to talk to people about her experience with anxiety. She&apos;s not close with her roommates, still hasn&apos;t talked about the issue with her dad, and still has days where she wants to cancel plans and stay home.</p>
  
        <p class="text">&quot;I&apos;ll sit and think about things for a long time,&quot; she said. &quot;I would go on Google and search &apos;How do I lie and say that I&apos;m not going to go to something without making people upset?&apos; I would look that up for hours.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">Her journey, far from over, has improved her life, however, and she&apos;s starting to find herself once more. From self-diagnosing with Web-MD to managing the issues with medication and counselling, Yosko gladly said she&apos;s able to enjoy her passions and even daily mundane activities again, something that escaped her those first semesters at university.</p>

        <p class="text">&quot;Everything I liked before going to college, I started hating…that&apos;s when I knew something was probably wrong,&quot; Yosko said. &quot;[But] I&apos;m able to do normal things again now, so that&apos;s good.&quot;</p>

        <p class="text">I&apos;ve always been a nervous person.</p>

        <p class="text">I think that stemmed from being an only child and having my parents&apos; expectations completely focused on me.</p>

        <p class="text">Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love my parents and had a great childhood. But, internally, I always had this idea that what I did had to be perfect. Whatever I did in school, as extracurriculars, whatever I was involved in, I had to make them proud.</p>

        <p class="text">Naturally, I felt very pressured. Just from the notion that everything I did was watched.</p>

        <p class="text">I first realized I had anxiety during my last semester of undergrad. I was a few weeks away from graduation and planned to go to Texas State University for graduate school. I was excited but terrified.</p>

        <p class="text">I spent my first year in college commuting from my parents&apos; home in downtown Houston to the main campus of the University of Houston. My life was basically the same as it always had been.</p>

        <p class="text">After finally deciding to transfer to Sam Houston State University after my year at UH, I found a new, emboldened lifestyle without daily pressure to please my parents. Four years there went by relatively smooth.</p>

        <p class="text">But during the last weeks of this final semester, I noticed something was wrong.</p>

        <p class="text">I could barely eat. A nervous tick, shaking my leg when I sat, got worse than it had always had been. And, most concerning, my heart rate seemed to increase, and there were times where it felt like it was racing after running a marathon.</p>

        <p class="text">Internally, I was incredibly concerned, but I never told anyone.</p>

        <p class="text">Since I had always been nervous, I figured it was the same issue I&apos;ve always had, and it would soon pass.</p>

        <p class="text">Graduation came and went, and on an early summer trip to North Carolina I found that racing heartbeat once again. In the back of the car driving between North Carolina and Tennessee, I clamed up, started sweating and couldn&apos;t catch my breath.</p>

        <p class="text">We reached a stop on our road trip, and I dashed for the bathroom. Once inside, I collapsed onto the stall wall and tried to breath. I had never had a freak out like this.</p>

        <p class="text">My nerves always manifested internally and would eventually subside. But they weren&apos;t today. Two more days of the road trip, and I felt the same. It wasn&apos;t till a few days after returning home that I felt <i>normal</i> again.</p>

        <p class="text">I had another moment heading to Los Angeles (which you can experience above) with similar feelings to what happened in North Carolina.</p>

        <p class="text">That&apos;s when I knew something wasn&apos;t right.</p>

        <p class="text">A month passed, with more episodes of uncontrollable nerves but no more freak outs. I had a doctor&apos;s appointment scheduled to check for an ear infection but decided to bring up my nerves to the doctor, too.</p>

        <p class="text">For whatever reason, I held back on telling him about the episodes in North Carolina and on the way to LA. Regardless, I was diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression and prescribed a very low dose of an antidepressant to help with the nerves.</p>

        <p class="text">A month later, I felt the same, if not worse.</p>

        <p class="text">My big move to San Marcos was coming up, and maybe anxiety from that was overriding what good the medication was doing. The doctor upped my dosage, and the symptoms actually got worse over the next two weeks.</p>

        <p class="text">A week into living in San Marcos I had another panic episode, completely unprovoked one night while lying in bed. I decided to visit the campus doctor to maybe switch medication when my prescription ran out in a few weeks.</p>

        <p class="text">I talk to the new doctor, who actually listened and attempted to find the root of my anxieties. He kept me on the same meds, letting me get a little more accustomed to them, before trying something else. He added, however, medication to take if I have another panic attack.</p>

        <p class="text">I never realized the two disorders were separate but often occur with each other. We discovered that my anxiety about my anxiety led to and manifested itself in panic attacks, where it felt like my heart would beat out of my chest.</p>

        <p class="text">There were times where I felt I had something physiologically wrong in my heart because it would beat so strong and fast. This is, apparently, common among people with panic disorder.</p>

        <p class="text">The antidepressant helped, and I&apos;ve only had to sparingly use the panic medicine on day with extra pressure. Perhaps settling into my new school and town helped calm the anxiety, but I&apos;ve found myself being more outgoing and positive in general.</p>

        <p class="text">Many of my friends have similar or other mental health issues, so I was surprised at the comfort and support they offered me once I told them what I had gone through. Mental health issues weren&apos;t something I talked or thought about until I realized I had them.</p>

        <p class="text">I think that&apos;s what&apos;s most detrimental to the state of mental health, especially with other college students my age. While discussion around the topic is getting better, there&apos;s still a stigma around mental health, and some don&apos;t take the disorders seriously.</p>

        <p class="text">I&apos;m left to wonder how many people could benefit from knowing it&apos;s ok to admit you feel anxious, or depressed, or have panic episodes. Rates of mental health disorders are increasing, but perhaps that&apos;s from people finally feeling comfortable enough to confront the problem.</p>

        <p class="text">Being offered advice like &apos;Just don&apos;t be nervous,&apos; or &apos;Why are you sad? You have nothing to be sad about,&apos; pushes these issues deeper into those who suffer from them, and this internalization is what&apos;s most dangerous.</p>

        <p class="text">We need to recognize that it&apos;s ok not to be ok and asking for help can save lives and livelihood.</p>

        <p class="text">Jumping that hurdle has helped me tremendously, and I know it can help others, too.</p>
